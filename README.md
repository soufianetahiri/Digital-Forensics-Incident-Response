# Introduction
This post is inspired by all the hard working DFIR, and more broadly security professionals, who have put in the hard yards over the years to discuss in depth digital forensics and incident response.

# Disclaimer
This page contains a variety of commands and concepts which are known through experience, higher education, tutorials, online blogs, YouTube Videos, professional training, reading the manual, and more. All references to original posts or material will aim to be documented in the ‘Special Thanks’ section. This is not designed as a manual on how to perform DFIR, and serves only as a quick reference sheet for commands, tools, and common items of interest when performing Incident Response. If you need to undertake Digital Forensics for legal proceedings, seek specialist advice.

# Artifact locations
A number of forensic artifacts are known for a number of operating systems.

A large number of these are covered on the Digital Forensics Artifact Repository, and can be ingested both by humans and systems given the standard YAML format.
